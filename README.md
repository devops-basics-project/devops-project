# DevOps Automation Project

## Introduction
This project is planned as a simple DevOps demonstration project.  
The main purpose of this project is to learn and implement DevOps practices using Docker and Jenkins.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to build a basic CI/CD pipeline where:

- An application is containerized using Docker  
- Jenkins is used to automate build and deployment  
- Code changes can be deployed automatically  
- Manual work in deployment is reduced  

## Tools and Technologies
The following tools will be used in this project:

- Docker – for containerizing the application  
- Jenkins – for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment  
- Git – for version control  
- GitHub – for storing project code  

## Planned Implementation

In this project, the following steps will be implemented:

1. Creating a simple application  
2. Writing a Dockerfile to containerize the application  
3. Installing and configuring Jenkins  
4. Connecting Jenkins with GitHub repository  
5. Automating build process using Jenkins  
6. Deploying the application using Docker containers  

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this project, the following skills will be gained:

- Understanding of Docker and containerization  
- Knowledge of Jenkins automation  
- Practical understanding of CI/CD workflow  
- Experience with DevOps tools and practices  

## Future Enhancements

The project can be improved in the future by adding:

- Automated testing  
- Cloud deployment  
- Monitoring and logging  
- Kubernetes support  

---

This project is being developed mainly for learning and practicing DevOps concepts.
